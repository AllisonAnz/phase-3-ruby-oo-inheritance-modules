# Modules 
# Previously we discussed the concept of inheritance 
# We learned that through subclasses(a certain class under superclass), the subclass has 
# access to all of the methods of its parent class 

# Think of an example, one that is less hierarchical 
# Like writing an app that modules the envirionment of dance performances 
# Such an app might have a Dance class 
# Dancers perform dances 

# Similarly we could imagine little kids going to see the Nutcracker ballet one Chirstmas 

# WE might write a Kid class in which as instance of the class 
# our little kid has access to all those ballet moves 

# This is where modules come in 
# Modules allow us to collect and bundle a group of methods and make those methods 
# available to any number of classes
